      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p> Hi, this is Kay! We are students at University of Michigan, I am studying Human-Computer Interaction and Chengyang is studying
        Mechanical Engineering. We travelled to many places, the first time we went to road trip together was in winter 2016.
        We went to Mexico City together, and decided to drive to the rest of the cities. But the first time we were on a actual long
        road trip was in winter 2017. The reason we chose to do a road trip was because we wanted to take my dog Bobi with us. We
       drove all the way from Ann Arbor to Key West, and it was so fun and had a lot of freedom. We drove off the highway to some
       random beaches, found a lot surprises along the road. So we started doing more road trip! </p>
